It was developed by Warthog, a British game studio, and published by Infogrames, a French company, in 1999 for two platforms: Microsoft Windows and the original PlayStation. The game belongs to the genre of turn-based strategy, where the player has to plan their moves carefully and take turns with the enemy. The goal of the game is to liberate all the provinces of Gaul from the Roman occupation and to collect the ingredients for a magic potion that gives super strength to the Gauls. The player can do this by completing different types of challenges: minigames that test their reflexes and skills, and platforming stages that require them to jump and avoid obstacles. The ingredients for the potion are hidden at the end of each platforming stage.
  
The game features the main characters from the comic books: Asterix, a brave and cunning warrior; Obelix, his loyal and strong friend; Getafix, the druid who makes the magic potion; and Dogmatix, Obelix's pet dog. The player can control Asterix or Obelix in the minigames and platforming stages, and switch between them at any time. Each character has their own abilities and weaknesses: Asterix is faster and can use his helmet as a weapon, while Obelix is slower but can carry heavy objects and knock down enemies with his fists. Dogmatix can also help by biting the Romans or fetching items.

The game has a map screen where the player can choose which province to visit. There are 12 provinces in total, each with its own theme and difficulty level. Some provinces are optional, while others are mandatory to advance the story. The player can also visit the Gaulish village, where they can talk to other characters, buy items from the shop, or play bonus minigames. The game has a humorous tone and references many events and characters from the comic books.

Asterix: The Gallic War received mixed reviews from critics and fans. Some praised the game for its faithful adaptation of the comic books, its variety of gameplay modes, and its colorful graphics. Others criticized the game for its repetitive minigames, its frustrating platforming stages, and its lack of voice acting. The game was also compared unfavorably to other Asterix games that were released around the same time, such as Asterix & Obelix for the Super Nintendo and Asterix & Obelix Take On Caesar for the PlayStation.
