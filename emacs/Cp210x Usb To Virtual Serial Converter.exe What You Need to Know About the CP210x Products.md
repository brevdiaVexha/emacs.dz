# How to Install and Use Cp210x Usb To Virtual Serial Converter.exe
 
Cp210x Usb To Virtual Serial Converter.exe is a driver file that enables communication between a USB device and a serial port on a computer. It is part of the CP210x USB to UART Bridge Virtual COM Port (VCP) drivers developed by Silicon Labs. These drivers are required for device operation as a Virtual COM Port to facilitate host communication with CP210x products, such as microcontrollers, sensors, and modems.

In this article, we will show you how to download, install, and use Cp210x Usb To Virtual Serial Converter.exe on different operating systems.
 
## Downloading Cp210x Usb To Virtual Serial Converter.exe
 
The default, unmodified drivers from Silicon Labs are associated with the VID and PID programmed onto CP210x devices by default. These defaults are listed below:

| Device | Default VID | Default PID |
| --- | --- | --- |

| CP2101-4/CP2102N | 0x10C4 | 0xEA60 |

| CP2105 | 0x10C4 | 0xEA70 |

| CP2108 | 0x10C4 | 0xEA71 |

You can download the default drivers from [here](https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers). Alternatively, you can modify the drivers by using the utility found with AN200, [here](https://www.silabs.com/support/resources.ct-application-notes.ct-example-code.p-interface), to change the VID and PID of your CP210x device.
 
If you want to automatically download and install the drivers using Windows Update, you need to program a different set of PIDs onto the CP210x device. This allows a user to merely connect a CP210x device to a Windows machine and be able to use it without having to manually download and install drivers. The PIDs that must be programmed to the CP210x device are listed below:

| Device | Windows Update VID | Windows Update PID |
| --- | --- | --- |

| CP2101-4/CP2102N | 0x10C4 | 0xEA63 |

| CP2105 | 0x10C4 | 0xEA7A |

| CP2108 | 0x10C4 | 0xEA7B |
