The music of El Camino Real is inspired by the rich and diverse cultural heritage of the region, blending elements of Spanish, Mexican, and Native American musical traditions. The work consists of five movements, each depicting a different aspect of the road and its history.
 
- The first movement, *Fanfare and March*, introduces the main theme of the work, a lively and rhythmic melody that represents the spirit of adventure and exploration.
- The second movement, *Interlude*, is a lyrical and expressive contrast to the first movement, featuring a solo flute and a solo trumpet. It evokes the peaceful and pastoral scenery along the road.
- The third movement, *Fiesta*, is a festive and colorful celebration of the diverse cultures and traditions that coexist along the road. It incorporates elements of folk dances, mariachi music, and jazz.
- The fourth movement, *Pilgrimage*, is a solemn and reverent tribute to the religious significance of the road and its missions. It features a chorale-like melody played by the brass section, followed by a solo euphonium.
- The fifth movement, *Finale*, is a triumphant and energetic conclusion that recapitulates the main theme of the work and brings it to a climactic end.
