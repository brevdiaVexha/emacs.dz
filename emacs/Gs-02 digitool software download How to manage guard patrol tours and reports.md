## What is DigiTool and How Does It Work?
 
DigiTool is a state-of-the-art patrol system that is designed to improve security and deliver peace of mind. DigiTool enables simpler and more effective security staff monitoring and supervision. Each DigiTool product is aesthetically designed to add an air of modernity and sophistication to any security operation.
 
DigiTool works by using iButton checkpoints that are installed along the patrol route. Each iButton has a unique ID that is read by the GS-01 Data Collector when it touches it. The GS-01 Data Collector records the time, date, and location of each checkpoint scan, as well as the ID of the guard who performed it. The GS-01 Data Collector can store up to 4,000 events in its memory.
 
At the end of the patrol, the guard returns the GS-01 Data Collector to the GC-02 Base docking-station. The GC-02 Base transfers the patrol data to the Gs-02 DigiTool software on the PC via infrared. The Gs-02 DigiTool software allows you to view, analyze, and export the patrol data in various formats. You can also use the Gs-02 DigiTool software to create and edit patrol routes, assign guards to shifts, and set up alerts and notifications.
