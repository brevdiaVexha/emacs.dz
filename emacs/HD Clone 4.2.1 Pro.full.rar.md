One of the best features of HDClone Free Edition is that it supports both the FAT and NTFS partitions for backing up and restoring your system. If you want to create a backup of your Windows system, all you have to do is to download the software, install it and then let it create an image of your hard drive. You can also choose to copy your entire hard disk or just a specific partition. In the same way, if you want to restore a specific folder or file from your hard drive using the Windows operating system, you will only have to select it from the list offered on the HDClone interface. Once you click on it, you will be asked to enter the path or name of the file that you want to restore.
 
HDClone Free Edition is compatible with all types of Windows operating systems including Windows XP, Windows Vista and also Windows 7. It can also work with proprietary formats which would otherwise be inaccessible. It has a user-friendly interface that guides you through the cloning process step by step. You can also watch video tutorials provided by the software developer Miray Software to learn how to install and configure the HD cloning process.
