## Design of Hotel Management System
 
The design of a hotel management system can be done using various tools and techniques, such as data flow diagrams (DFDs), entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs), use case diagrams (UCDs), and class diagrams (CDs). These tools and techniques help to visualize and model the data, processes, entities, relationships, use cases, and classes involved in the system. The following are some examples of these diagrams for a hotel management system:
