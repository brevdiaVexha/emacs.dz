Human Zbuilder is a plugin for Zbrush that allows you to create highly detailed human or creature models in Zbrush without any Zbrush skills. You can mix and match different models, morphs, poses, textures and hair styles to create unique characters or creatures. You can also edit your own models and integrate them into Zbuilder as custom presets. Human Zbuilder supports Zbrush 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023 for Windows and OSX.

You can also sell physical 3D or 2D prints on online stores. However, you cannot resale digital 3D models created with Human Zbuilder on online marketplace stores, game assets stores, 3D print stores for digital models or other online stores for digital 3D models.

Human Zbuilder has received positive reviews from many users who have praised its ease of use, variety of options, quality of models and compatibility with Zbrush. Some of the reviews are:
 
- "Great to create many kinds of heads, but know that you can't just create anything you want. There are limits, you will most likely not be able to make exactly the head you want, but it will give you a good base to model on, and it's easy to export. The sliders interface could use a bit of work, so I'm giving 4 stars." - John Grey[^1^]
- "What I needed!" - Arsentis Akimov[^1^]
- "As far as zbrush goes, this is the best plugin for head morphs and easy head creation. I would request that more morphs and dials are added to make it a more super unique head app for zbrush and randomization feature added." - Rry[^1^]
- "This is an amazing plugin for Zbrush. It allows you to create very realistic and detailed human and creature models in minutes. You can customize everything from the shape, size, color, texture, hair and pose of your model. You can also export your model in different formats and render passes. It's very easy to use and fun to play with. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to make characters in Zbrush." - Daniel Smith[^2^]
- "I love this plugin! It's so versatile and powerful. You can create any type of human or creature you can imagine with just a few clicks and sliders. The models are very high quality and have clean topology and UVs. The presets for lighting, materials, fibers and rendering are also very useful and save a lot of time. This plugin is a must-have for any Zbrush user who wants to make characters." - Laura Jones[^2^]
