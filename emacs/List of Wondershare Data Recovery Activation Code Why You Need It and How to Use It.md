## How to Find a List of Wondershare Data Recovery Activation Code?
 
There are two legitimate ways to get a list of Wondershare Data Recovery activation code: one is to visit the official website and sign up for a free trial version, and the other is to use a coupon code to get a lower price for the premium version. Here are the steps for each method:
 
### Method 1: Visit the Official Website and Sign Up for a Free Trial Version
 
The free trial version of Wondershare Data Recovery allows you to recover up to 100MB of data and preview the recovered files before saving them. It also supports various types of data and devices. To get the free trial version, you need to follow these steps[^1^]:
