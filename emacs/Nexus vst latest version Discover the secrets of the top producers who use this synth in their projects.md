One of the main features of NEXUS VST is its advanced librarian, which allows you to browse, search, and organize thousands of sounds in a user-friendly interface. You can filter by category and tags, bookmark your favorites, and access your own presets in a dedicated location. You can also preview sounds instantly with the search-while-you-type function[^1^].
 
NEXUS VST also boasts a powerful arpeggiator that lets you create complex patterns and melodies with up to 16 layers. You can edit each layer individually or globally, adjust the speed, length, swing, gate, and groove of each step, and choose from hundreds of presets or create your own. You can also zoom in and out of the arpeggiator view and follow the playback with the new \"follow\" option[^1^].
 
Another key feature of NEXUS VST is its flexible routing system, which gives you full control over the signal flow of your sounds. You can see the entire routing overview of your preset on the routing page, where you can edit oscillators, layers, and effects on one screen. You can also add or remove effects anywhere in the chain, drag and drop them between groups, and toggle them on and off with one click[^2^].
 
NEXUS VST comes with a wide range of effects to enhance your sounds, such as reverb, delay, chorus, flanger, phaser, distortion, compression, EQ, filter, limiter, and more. Some of the new effects added in the latest version are \"Tube\", \"Fuzzer\", \"Ducker\", \"Follower\", and \"Black Hole\"[^2^]. You can also modulate any parameter with four quick-access macro controls and 24 modulation slots[^1^].
 
NEXUS VST is constantly updated with new features and bug fixes to ensure optimal performance and compatibility. The latest version of NEXUS VST is version 4.5.6[^2^], which was released on March 12th 2023. This version fixed a minor issue with the 'a+b' modulation function[^2^]. To update your NEXUS VST to the latest version, you can use the reFX Cloud App[^1^], which makes installing NEXUS VST and any expansions easy.
 
NEXUS VST also offers a huge selection of expansions covering various genres and styles of EDM. Each expansion contains hundreds of presets that are designed by professional sound designers and producers. Some of the newest expansions are \"Slap House 2\", \"Lo-fi 2\", \"Future Rave\", \"Vintage Synths 2\", \"EDM 8\", \"Studio Production 3 Guitars\", \"Melodic Techno\", and \"Bigtone Signature 4\"[^1^].
