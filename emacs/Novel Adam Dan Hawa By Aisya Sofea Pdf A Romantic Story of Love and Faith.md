- "Adam yang ditinggalkan, menghitung hari-hari nan sepi. Setiap saat rindunya terus melimpah. Namun Ain tidak pernah berpaling melihat cinta yang mekar di hatinya. Ah..Adam pasrah! Semua itu salahnya kerana tidak berani memaknakan kata-kata. Setelah lapan tahun pergi dan menanti, Ain dan Adam dipertemukan di depan pintu Majidilharam."[^1^]
- "i'll lend u my shoulder to u cry on,my hand to u hold,my feet to walk with u....but i can't lend u my heart..coz it already belongs to..someone.."[^2^]
- "Hawa dicipta dari tulang rusuk Adam, Bukan dari kepalanya untuk dijadikan atasannya, Bukan dari kakinya untuk dijadikan alasannya, Melainkan dari sisinya untuk dijadikan teman hidupnya, Dekat pada lengan untuk dilindunginya Dan dekat di hati untuk dicintainya."[^2^]
