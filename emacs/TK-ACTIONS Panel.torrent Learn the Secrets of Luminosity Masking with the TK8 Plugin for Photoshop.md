## How to Use TK-ACTIONS Panel?
 
Using TK-ACTIONS Panel is easy and intuitive. The panel has a simple and logical interface that guides you through the steps of creating and applying masks. You can access the panel from the Window menu in Photoshop and dock it to your preferred location. The panel consists of several modules that perform different functions, such as Multi-Mask, RapidMask, Combo, Cx, Batch, and My Actions. You can switch between the modules by clicking on their icons at the top of the panel.
 
The Multi-Mask module is where you can create and output various types of masks based on different sources, such as luminosity, color, saturation, hue, vibrance, channels, and alpha channels. You can also create edge masks that target the edges and details in your image. To create a mask, you first need to select a source from the drop-down menu at the top left of the module. Then you can use the buttons below to generate different masks based on the source. For example, if you select luminosity as the source, you can create lights, darks, midtones, zone, and custom luminosity masks. You can also modify the masks by using the sliders and buttons at the bottom of the module. For example, you can adjust the brightness, contrast, feathering, and levels of the masks. You can also invert, intersect, subtract, or add masks to create more complex masks.
 
Once you have created a mask that suits your needs, you can output it to various destinations by using the buttons at the top right of the module. For example, you can output the mask as an adjustment layer with a layer mask that applies the mask to your image. You can also output the mask as a selection that allows you to make further adjustments or transformations to your image. You can also output the mask as a pixel layer that converts the mask into a grayscale image that you can use for other purposes. You can also output the mask as a burn/dodge layer that allows you to selectively darken or lighten areas of your image. You can also output the mask as a filter layer that applies a filter effect to your image based on the mask. You can also output the mask as a paint layer that allows you to paint on your image with a brush that follows the mask.

The RapidMask module is another way to create and modify masks in TK-ACTIONS Panel. It is similar to the Multi-Mask module but has some additional features and tools. The RapidMask module allows you to create masks based on luminosity or color channels by using two sets of buttons: Source and Mask. The Source buttons allow you to select a source for creating masks, such as RGB, red channel, green channel, blue channel, or any combination of channels. The Mask buttons allow you to create different masks based on the source, such as lights, darks, midtones, zone, custom luminosity masks, or color range masks. You can also modify the masks by using the sliders and buttons at the bottom of the module.
 
The RapidMask module also has some unique features that make it more powerful and versatile than the Multi-Mask module. For example, it has an Auto-Apply option that automatically applies any mask you create or modify to your image without having to output it manually. It also has a View option that allows you to view any mask as a red overlay on your image or as a grayscale image in a separate window. It also has a Modify option that allows you to access more tools for modifying masks, such as curves, levels, hue/saturation, brightness/contrast, color balance, selective color, black & white, gradient map, invert, blur/sharpen/noise filters.
