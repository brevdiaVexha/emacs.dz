One of the main advantages of Heat Up 3 is that it uses high quality multi samples recorded from many different sources, such as real recorded instruments like pianos and brasses, as well as samples from a multitude of analog and digital hardware. Heat Up 3 captures the unique sound of lots of different types of instruments, all rolled into one easy to use plugin.

You can also add extra atmosphere to your instruments with sounds like tape hiss, vinyl sounds, wind, rain and more. You can even drag and drop your own samples to use as an atmosphere layer.
 
Another great feature of Heat Up 3 is the powerful sequencer that comes with lots of presets to inspire your next song. You can create complex melodies and rhythms with ease using the step sequencer, piano roll or live recording mode. You can also add some human feel to your sequences with the humanize mode that randomizes velocity and timing.
 
Heat Up 3 also comes with 12 high quality effects in a reorderable effect rack, such as Reverb, Chorus, Compressor, Vibrato, Tremolo, Reverse and more. You can apply effects to individual layers or to the whole instrument. You can also use 2 ADSR envelopes and 2 LFOs with waveform editor to modulate any parameter you want.
 
Heat Up 3 has a crystal clear limiting algorithm that limits the output of the plugin. Even if the output goes above 0 decibels (clipping), there will be zero distortion. You can also select a sample to play on release either always or randomly. You can drag and drop your own release samples as well.
