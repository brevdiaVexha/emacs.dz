If you are looking for a way to design and animate maps directly in After Effects, you should check out GEOlayers 3 1.0. This is a new version of the popular extension that lets you access and customize maps from different online data sources. You can also use it to draw and label geospatial features of the world, such as countries, cities, buildings, rivers, and more.
  
GEOlayers 3 1.0 has many new features and improvements that make it faster and more powerful than ever. Here are some of the highlights:

- You can animate maps in 3D space with intuitive controls. You can scroll, zoom, pitch, and rotate your maps inside After Effects, create keyframes and animate them.
- You can style your maps however you want. You can choose colors, adjust the line width, swap fonts, add hillshading to your maps and even show and hide certain groups of features. You can also create your own style from the colors of a composition, an image or Adobe Swatch file.
- You can find geographical features online with a simple search. You can search for countries, cities, famous buildings, points of interest, and much more. The features you find can be labeled in your animation, they can be drawn to your map, downloaded, and even exported out for further analysis in an external GIS program.
- You can use MapTiler Cloud to access customizable basemaps directly in After Effects. MapTiler Cloud is a platform that lets you create and host your own map styles. You can use it to change the look and feel of your maps, add custom data layers, and optimize them for performance.

GEOlayers 3 1.0 is compatible with After Effects CC 2015 (13.6) or higher. It also works well with other plugins such as Mettle FreeForm Pro or Rowbyte Plexus. You can purchase GEOlayers 3 1.0 from aescripts.com for $329.99 or try it for free before buying.
  
If you want to learn more about GEOlayers 3 1.0, you can watch some tutorials on YouTube[^2^] or visit the official website[^1^]. GEOlayers 3 1.0 is a must-have tool for anyone who wants to create stunning map animations in After Effects.
  
One of the most impressive features of GEOlayers 3 1.0 is the ability to create 3D landscapes from your maps. You can use Helium, a plugin that comes with GEOlayers 3 1.0, to extrude your maps and add realistic lighting and shadows. You can also use Helium to animate the terrain and create dynamic camera movements.

Another feature that makes GEOlayers 3 1.0 stand out is the automatic labeling system. You can easily add labels to your maps that follow the curvature and perspective of the map. You can also customize the appearance and behavior of the labels, such as font size, color, alignment, and animation. You can even use expressions to control the labels based on data or logic.
  
GEOlayers 3 1.0 also supports CSV files, which are a common format for storing tabular data. You can import CSV files into GEOlayers 3 1.0 and use them to create data-driven maps. For example, you can use CSV files to show population density, climate change, or COVID-19 cases on your maps. You can also use CSV files to create animated routes or trails on your maps.
