# How to Use VBB Arduino Toolkit to Simulate Arduino Projects
 
If you are interested in Arduino projects but don't have the hardware or the space to set up a physical breadboard, you might want to try VBB Arduino Toolkit, a software that allows you to simulate Arduino circuits on your computer.
 
VBB Arduino Toolkit is a feature of Virtual Breadboard (VBB), a program that emulates circuits with microcontrollers and components. VBB Arduino Toolkit works with your physical microcontroller via the EDGEY interface, which means you can use the same code and libraries as you would with a real Arduino board.

In this article, we will show you how to use VBB Arduino Toolkit to create and run a simple Arduino project: the blink tutorial. You will need to have VBB installed on your computer and activate the Arduino Toolkit feature. You can purchase the Arduino Toolkit license from [here](http://www.virtualbreadboard.com/Main.aspx?TAB=5). The invoice number is the serial activation code.
 
## Step 1: Create a New Project
 
Open VBB and click on File > New Project. Give your project a name and select Arduino as the project type. You will see a blank workspace with an Arduino Uno board on the left and a breadboard on the right.
 
## Step 2: Add an LED and a Resistor
 
To make the LED blink, we need to connect it to one of the digital pins of the Arduino board. We also need a resistor to limit the current and protect the LED from burning out. To add these components, click on the Components tab on the top menu and select Basic > LED and Basic > Resistor. Drag and drop them onto the breadboard.
 
Connect one leg of the resistor to pin 13 of the Arduino board and the other leg to the longer (positive) lead of the LED. Connect the shorter (negative) lead of the LED to the ground (GND) pin of the Arduino board. You can use wires of different colors to make your connections easier to follow.
 
## Step 3: Write and Upload the Code
 
Now we need to write some code to tell the Arduino board what to do with the LED. Click on the Code tab on the top menu and select Arduino IDE. This will open a new window with an integrated development environment (IDE) for writing and uploading Arduino code.
 
In the IDE, type or copy and paste the following code:
 `
// define pin 13 as LED_PIN
#define LED_PIN 13

// setup function runs once when you press reset or power on
void setup() 
  // initialize digital pin LED_PIN as an output
  pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT);

// loop function runs repeatedly
void loop() 
  // turn on LED by setting pin high
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH);
  // wait for one second
  delay(1000);
  // turn off LED by setting pin low
  digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW);
  // wait for one second
  delay(1000);

` 
This code defines pin 13 as LED\_PIN and sets it as an output. Then it creates a loop that alternately turns on and off the LED by setting pin high or low, with a one-second delay between each state change.

To upload this code to your virtual Arduino board, click on Tools > Board > Arduino Uno and then click on Sketch > Upload. You should see some messages in the bottom window indicating that your code is compiling and uploading.
 
## Step 4: Run and Test Your Project
 
Once your code is uploaded, you can run your project by clicking on Run > Start Simulation. You should see your LED blinking on and off every second on your virtual breadboard.
 
You can also test your project with a real Arduino board if you have one connected to your computer via USB. To do this, click on Run > Stop Simulation and then click on Tools > Serial Port > COMx (where x is the number of your USB port). Then click on Sketch > Upload again and watch your physical LED blink.
 
## Conclusion
 
In this article, we have shown you how to use VBB Arduino Toolkit to simulate Arduino projects on your computer.
