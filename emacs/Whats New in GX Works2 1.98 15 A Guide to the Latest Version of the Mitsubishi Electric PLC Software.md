In this article, we will introduce some of the new features and improvements in GX Works2 version 1.98 15, which was released in October 2020.
 
## Support for Universal Model High-Speed Type QCPU
 
One of the major enhancements in GX Works2 version 1.98 15 is the support for the Universal model high-speed type QCPU module, which has a greatly improved operation and processing speed for basic operations, structural instructions, and function block (FB) call functions. The Universal model high-speed type QCPU module can handle complex and large-scale applications with ease and efficiency. Users can use GX Works2 to easily control the next-generation high-speed CPU equipped with advanced functions such as security, data logging, and motion control.
 
## Coordination with PX Developer for Process Applications
 
GX Works2 version 1.98 15 also enables coordination with PX Developer, a software tool for creating sequence and loop control programs for process/redundant CPU. By using GX Works2 and PX Developer together, users can create programs that integrate both discrete and continuous control logic for process applications. Users can also monitor and debug the programs using GX Works2's online functions.
 
## Batch Control of Various Factory Automation Devices
 
GX Works2 version 1.98 15 also improves the coordination with various factory automation devices such as simple motion modules, power measurement modules, and iQ Sensor Solution (iQSS) compatible partner sensor products. Users can use GX Works2 to set and monitor the parameters of these devices without a manual. Users can also confirm the connection state and current values of the sensors with graphical displays, allowing quick troubleshooting.
 
## Conclusion
 
GX Works2 version 1.98 15 is a powerful and versatile PLC engineering software that supports the latest MELSEC series products and features. It allows users to create programs using different languages, manage projects efficiently, standardize programs across devices, and coordinate with various factory automation devices. GX Works2 version 1.98 15 is available for download from the Mitsubishi Electric website[^1^].
