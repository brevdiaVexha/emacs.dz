Sundarar is regarded as one of the four great saints of Tamil Shaivism, along with Appar, Sambandar and Manikkavasagar. He is also known as Chuntarar, Chuntaramurtti, Nampi Aruran or Tampiran Tolan. He composed over 300 hymns in praise of various forms and aspects of Shiva, which are collected in the seventh volume of the Tirumurai, the canonical scripture of Tamil Shaivism. His hymns are known for their musicality, lyrical beauty and emotional intensity.
 
Sundarar's life was full of miracles and divine interventions. He is said to have received a golden axe from Shiva to cut down a palm tree that obstructed his view of the temple. He also received a golden hand from Shiva to replace his severed hand that was bitten by a crocodile. He was cured of his blindness by the grace of Shiva after he sang a hymn in Thiruvennainallur. He also had the power to revive the dead by singing hymns in their ears.
 
Sundarar travelled extensively throughout Tamil Nadu, visiting various Shiva temples and singing his hymns. He also had many disciples and followers who accompanied him in his journeys. He had a special bond with Cheraman Perumal, the king of Kerala, who became his devotee and friend. Sundarar also had two wives, Paravaiyar and Sangiliyar, who were both temple dancers and devotees of Shiva. They supported Sundarar in his spiritual quest and shared his love for Shiva.
